This is my first post using a new environment. This blog is hosted on GitHub and use GitHub Pages.

I copied a dessing from http://francho.org and also read how create this site using JeKyll.

The purpose of this blog is to practice english and also add my ideas, new knowledge and add tips or something for use in a future or not.

I think to practice better is write often and short posts.
